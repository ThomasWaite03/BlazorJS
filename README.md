# BlazorJS
BlazorJS is a library that enables Blazor developers to interact with the Web APIs without having to write JavaScript. It leverages JavaScript interop to provide Web API access through C#.

## Features
âœ… **C# Wrappers for JavaScript APIs**  
âœ… **Encapsulates JavaScript Calls** - No need to write JS manually  
âœ… **Simplifies JavaScript Interop** - Use familiar C# syntax  

## Setup
In your `Program.cs`, register the libraryâ€™s services by adding the following line:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddBlazorJS();
```

## Usage
### Console API Example
```razor
@using BlazorJS;

@inject IJSConsole _console

@code {
  protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
  {
    // Log to the browser console
    _console.Log("Hello world!");
    _console.Error("This is an error!");
  }
}
```
